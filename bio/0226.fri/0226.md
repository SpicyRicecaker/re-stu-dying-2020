## Colorimetry Lab - calories and Calories

### Warmup

1. Why do we eat? 2

- To maintain our metabolic processes
- Eating gives us energy by breaking down foods into sugars, used immediately as ATP or stored as glucose or lipids
  - Without energy, we cannot function, cannot undergo cellular respiration

2. What is your food made out of at the molecular level

- Food is made up of organic molecules - proteins, carbs, and lipids
- For fruits and vegetables saccharides make up a large protion of the plant, in cell walls

3. What groups do you think has the most cal/g

- Lipids

### Cellular Respiration

- Converts chemical energy (stored energy in the form of sugar (glucose) from food) into useable energy in the form of ATP
- **ATP** carries out cellular functions that require energy, currency for the cell
- All living things do some form of cellular respiration
- Prokaryotes
  - Cells that don't have nucleus
- Eukaryotes
  - Cells that have a nucleus
  - Membrane-bound organelles

### Calories

- _Amount of heat_ is measured in `calories`
- 1 calorie = amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1 C
  - Specific Heat of Water: 1.0 cal/g C
- 1 `C`alorie = 1000 `c`alories
- Calorie is `kilo-calorie`, shown on Food Labels

### Nutrition Label

- _Serving size_ multiplies the nutrition info
- 1g lipids = 9.5 Cal
- 1g carbs = 4.2 Cal
- 1g protein = 4.1 Cal

### What are we doing in lab

- Calories (stored energy) into calories (heat energy)
- `Initial Mass` of food item (+ food holder)
- `Final Mass` of burnt food item (+ food holder)
- `Initial Temp` of water before burning
- `Initial Temp` of water after burning
- `Amount of water` = 100mL = 100g
- Controls
  - Bottom of can 1cm from top
  - Tip of thermometer in water, not bottom tho
  - 1 match per food item

### TODO

- Work on intro portion of lab
  - Use _underlined_ headings in lab report
  - 1 Page Only



- Diagetic sounds
  - Air
    - Really light
- Non-diagetic sounds

- Colorful
  - Warm colors, bright blue
  - Red gives off a feeling of heat 
    - Heat rising
    - Heat for comfortable
  - Blue
    - Blue for cool
