## Uniform Circular Motion

## Homework

The normal foce

```latex
F_n = mg + ma
```

???

```latex
F_net = w (m + g)
```

The force of air resistance

```latex
- F_air + mg\sin(8\deg) = 0
```

Tension forces pulling different directions

```latex
T_{2x} - T_{1x} = 0
```

23:22 = Hey, currently working on finding the physics slidedeck for p51
23:26 = Hey, currently solving p51 (with some help lol)
23:34 = What's up bro? Currently working on the clown problem
  - btw, should we charge the calculator for the upcoming test?
- ## 23:45, breaktime! probably gonna clean up my workspace, get some fruits to power up!
- 23:43 = oi, how're you holding up? we're correct p54, then we should be able to submit!
- 00:08 oi, how's it going? Currently done with 53, exporting to png and converting w/ magick. Fun times!
- 00:12 = oi, just finished 20 hw, but I'm gonna triage (tomorrow seems like an important day), and Imma try to get 22hw done
- ## 00:22 I'm feeling a bit tired, gonna do some flexibility exercises a bit
- 00:15 oioi, so we're gonna read through example 17 and 18 and tackle the problems!
