## After today, there'll be 3 days of reprieve
- 22:18 If we get through the busy work bio and physics homework today, and then go fullspeed on the 1984 notes, then the only thing that we'll have to worry about tomorrow is the discussion. From there, it's a 3 day, much-needed break! Anyway, right now we're filling out our TODOs, we'll start from the top
