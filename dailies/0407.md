# Bio homework, but it's after you realize there're moar handwritten notes due at noon...
- *23:51* Yikes my eyes
- 23:18 let's get the lab done!
- *00:21* we chill
- 23:56 (placeholder) => working on bio 11.1
- *01:01* rest my eye, my soul, etc., get some water
- 00:28 I think we still work on 11.1, the good news is that it's only 4 pages of notes so not so bad.
- 01:08 The goal has shifted from "let's do this haha" to we need to finish as fast as possible if we don't want to have our sleep crash into the alarm clock momentously haha
