## HL Essay: Intro and First Samples (Women's Health)

### Read Samples, inc. Feedback

- Note strengths, weaknessness, questions
- Intro is good because it starts with an anecdote, establishes platform/view
  - However, too long
- Second # states that _Women's Health_ spreads far and wide
  - Don't cite sources from Wikipedia
- Readers should be able to negotiate with writers, but in a social view that is questionable
  - In a 1500 word essay, it's too varied
- Women are expected to be some way via men's view
- Analysis is very detailed, goes through what, how/effect, so what why
- Good, but 2 pg nothing

### Crit. A: Knowledge & Understanding

- 5, Good general understanding
- 4, Good analysis, but needs more sources
- 5, Textual implications are well connected to how magazines affect the view of women in sciety
- 2, There should've been many more sources than just Wikipedia, another article, and the cover itself
- **Overall** 4

### Crit. B: Analysis

- 5, Great textual features analyzed
- 5, Convincing, specfic analysis
- 4, related to the chosen topic but again, organization affects relation
- 4, Moves through the what how effect so what why, but in a somewhat long-winded way
- **Overall** 5

### Crit. C: Focus, organization & development

- 3, very long first intro, verbose paragraphs until analysis
- 4, Line of inquiry for second page on was good, but bad for the first page
- 5, she needs more quotes and evidence, but where she did use them it was good
- **Overall** 4

### Crit. D: Use of Language

- 4, very good but hard to read for normal people
- 5, grammar is good, vocabulary and sentence construction are very high level
- 4, academic writing in the HL essay, but some say it is too dense
- **Overall** 5
