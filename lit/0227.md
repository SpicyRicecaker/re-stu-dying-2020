## Non-diagetic Sounds

### Music

- The sound of "alarms", very abrupt, starts and stops, notes from the piano

- Music from the elections are generally expected by the audience to be grand and and triumphant, like the American national anthem
- The Foreign music plays off xenophobia, it's abrumpt and has alarms, sounds like somethying you'd hear in a sci-fi movie or factory
  - These industrial, apocalyptic sounds seem to fortell the future that would befall the country if Joe Biden and his "Unity platform" were to be elected: a total takeover, infringing upon the rights of the American People and making the country a bad place

### Narration

- Female voice, matter-of-fact, what you'd expect to hear in a news report
  - More likely to be accepted than male voice? 

## Diagetic Sounds

- All diagetic sounds come from Joe Biden. "If you elect me your taxes are gonna be raised not cut", "Citizenship for 11 million undocumented folks", "Yes, Absolutely"
- Directly follows the narrator's claims, as if Joe Biden is explicitly revealing that what he's going to do is bad

## Structure

- Starts off with Joe Biden announcing that "Biden and Sanders Release Progressive Unity Platform", the narrator declaring that Joe Biden has embraced the radical left. It's followed by several bad news, such as increases in taxes, death, and so on. In the end, the image with the same composition is shown in which Joe Biden announces he and Sanders are making a Unity platform, but this time the outline of the United States is shown in the background, fully blue, with the caption: "DON'T LET THE RADICAL LEFT TAKE OVER." 
  - The structure of the commercial is clearly leading the viewer to believe that Joe Bidens Unity platform would lead directly to these bad events happening, with the final outcome of a takeover. This is further supported by the narrator, who seems to have a matter-of-fact tone similar to a news report. The explicit "don't let it happen message" is also implied via the structure of the commercial, which says what would happen
