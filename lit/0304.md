1. The word herd can be considered as a noun, used to describe a gathering of some animals, such as a herd of sheep or a herd of cows. It can also be thought of as a herd, with the person that usualy herds as a shephard. Usually moving an unruly, unorganized crowd in a certain direction. This implies that Her teeth, multiples, are out of order, and she's trying to get them in the same direction
