CUCO - Lover Is a Day (Treat as persuasive rhetoric + minor scale, how does the song feel like it goes on forever? 2018 song is 7:18 minutes)

Tom and Jerry - Blue Cat Blues ( Treat as ad analysis / magazine cover analysis, hard v. soft lines, context of reception is children, perhaps the director wants to warn children about gold diggers)


Shelter - Porter Robison (Treat as ad analysis / magazine cover, context of reception are anime watchers, since context of production consists of A-1 pictures, and Crunchyroll, an anime streaming service, how the camera angles have her painted small that shows beauty and yet loneliness)
