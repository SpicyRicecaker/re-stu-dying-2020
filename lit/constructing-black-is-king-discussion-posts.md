The ending song of *Black is King* left really strong impressions on me. Not just Beyonce's beautiful and confident vocals, but the striking visual colors and allusions the lyrics made to *Lion King* served to emphasize the message.
For example, I noticed that the entire church choir was wearing purple clothing. Historically, that color is tied to royalty because it was hard to obtain, and that ties in with the themes of rising back up to becoming *Kings* and *Queens* present throughout the entire visual album. 

The camera angle is pointed up toward the light, emphasizing its glory shining down into the entire church. If this light is the holy spirit, shining upon church members strongly singing, it alludes to the pledge of allegiance quite literally, "one nation under God, indivisible..."

The rays of light also may be an allusion to the original *Lion King*, with Rafiki holding up Simba on the mountain with the sun peeking out of the clouds. 
This is further supported by the lyrics
> Sayin' rise up  
> To the light in the sky, yeah  
> Let the light lift your heart up  
 
Referencing 'light in the sky' and 'rise up'.

Overall, because of rising lyrics, and visuals with many possible allusions, the song makes the listener feel full of hope and wonder for life.
