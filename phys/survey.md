## What are you curious about

I'm really curious about languages: how big of an effect do languages actually have on us, and our though processes? How does something like a computer language, and learning a computer language, differ from writing and learning a spoken language? 

## What is your biggest achievement

Up until now, my single greatest achievement in my high school career has been completing my Of Mice and Men project for lit and comp 10. This project was something that we had been building up to over weeks and weeks, each day reading chapters of the book at a time, every other day completing tests, quizzes, and assignments all. Now I had been struggling in class --- I found it hard to grasp the answer to these seemingly simple prompts -- but by going into AT more and more, and consulting my teacher, I was able to gain a better understanding of the book and characters in it. When the OMAM final project was finally assigned, on a dreary Thursday, I panicked slightly. I tried to schedule meetings for whenever I could, via breakfast, lunch, dinner, thanksgiving, and more, but was denied all except for Friday morning. I raced to get a working draft to be reviewed on the next morning. After receiving some positive feedback, I proceeded to spend three days and three nights grinding through this assignment. To keep my focus at a peek, I walked to Starbucks in the morning and stayed until it closed at night. To keep my motivation and performance at a peak, I tried drinking coffee Friday evening, thought it had absolutely no effect, and subsequently came to regret it that very night. The mournful Monday came, we turned in our assignments, and before we knew it, the assignment was graded. At that very moment, when the dust cleared, I quickly gazed upon the fruit that my effort bore: a Passing grade that everyone else got. 

Honestly though, it was a pretty big achievement in the sense that it was appreciated by my teacher, and I learned the power of seeking help when you need it and coffee shops.

## What are your hobbies

One hobby of mine is to build applications or websites that I believe that I might use in my daily life. Maybe a homepage extension or an app to organize my school files. Another thing I like to do in my freetime is to read manga. Manga are really great, they transport me to another world and instantly vaporize my freetime. The only time that I'm pulled out of my immersion is when the translation is slightly off. I also like speedrunning Minecraft, but because it is a randomly generated game, playing those bad randomly generated worlds can be a drag.

## What are your strengths

I think my strength is in technology, and coding. In this class, I want to apply physics through coding by making an application, or a game. However, I had Calc last year, and I wasn't able to come up with freetime, or rather just motivation to make something like that. 

## What brings out the best in you? What do you need?

In my life, the thing that brings out the best in me is a solid, uninterrupted, quality 9 hours and 30 minutes of sleep every day. If I get this amount of sleep while I'm on a consistent sleep schedule, the world stands absolutely no chance against me. Unfortunately, I have thus far been unable to maintain this amount of sleep for longer than three days and am thus being crushed by the duties that society has pushed onto me. 

## What do you do after high school

After highschool, I'm expecting to go straight into college, but recently I've found that open-sourced or free learning resources online have been of huge value to me, so I guess I'm not sure. Whatever the case, I'll be learning

## What concerns you about our world

One issue that really concerns me is poverty, and the disproportionate levels of wealth in countries around the world. Technology has had an immeasurable impact on me, and has given me so much power (and also distractions) through knowledge. I think that everyone should be able to at least have a compute or phone that has access to the internet, but that isn't the case today.

## Other

My sleep schedule right now is almost completely broken at the moment, but hopefully in the coming days/weeks I'll be able to correct it and better my work!
