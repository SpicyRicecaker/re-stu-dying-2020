## How is knowledge like a map of the world?

Knowledge is definitely like a hashmap of the world. From the fish names vs. dog sounds activity, it is clear that language matches basically abstract sounds to objects in real-life, like `woof` to dog or pez to fish. Other things like movement are a concept, so much of what knowledge is, is a map to a thing or a concept.

## Absent/Unexplored

Space, the universe

## 3,4 Maps that contradict each other

Different map projections in real life have different distortions and biases. For example, mercators projection of the map has North America a lot bigger than it actually is, while Peter's projection much closer to scale, with Africa as by far the biggest continent

## 5 Map metahpor - The Map is not the territory

The map metaphor is basically saying that what we believe is not reality. Being knowledgeable is being able to look at things from a different perspective.
