## Categories of human failing tied to Christian tradition

The sin of lust is definitely tied to that of temperance concerning self control and abstinence. Greed is also related to temperance and moderation of desires. Sloth is tied to prudence, self discipline, gluttony to prudence. Pride is connected to justice, envy with fortitude, and ire with prudence as well. These seven deadly sins have a lot to do with the four cardinal values

## Difference between guilt culture and shame culture

I think that a guilt culture comes from within, while shame is brought upon by others. For example, Christian tradition preaches penitance, saying that you've done something wrong and feeing guilt from wrongdoing. Shame culture is more like cancel culture where everyone is ready to jump on others to justify themselves.
