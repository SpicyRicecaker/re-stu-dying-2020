## Notes

- Protein folding, AI crushed all competition
- AlphaGO got good at Go, Shogi, and Chess
- Self-driving cars, rockets

## Disc

- Acquire or product of our knowledge
  - Challenges of not being able to understand how it works, racial profiling, trading glitches, boeing don't save plane
  - Could be both, since we created it, and yet in some areas like chess and shogi it surpasses us
    - Both, sine we created it, and it can help us as well
- Technology as mandatory in school?
  - Since technology is so intertwined in our daily lives, we would be remiss not to include it in our curriculum
  - However, with many people in government being technologically illiterate it is going to be a challenge
- If you could store, what would you do with the rest of time
  - We should probably still talk about AI, since we're still going at a slow pace at the moment
  - We also shouldn't put all our trust into AI, since AI is pretty glitchy at the moment
