<h1 id="letter-to-future-me">Letter to Future Me</h1>
<p>Dear me in the future,</p>
<p>How are you doing? Right now for me, as I&#39;m sure you know, things are doomed. Each one of my classes is exponentially harder than my classes last semester, and combined the pressure is killing me. I haven&#39;t even started SAT prep yet. Have you made it through all of this? Have you climbed the insurmountable mountain of IB Biology with Bell, or trudged through the IB Physics textbooks, or done the lit LPs? </p>
<p>But most of all, I hope that you&#39;ve worked on what <em>you</em> wanted to do. Learning japanese, if only you&#39;re just a slight bit better than me right now, learning how to design stuff with CSS and finally making a game with Rust + Svelte. Reading books for your own enjoyment again...</p>
<p>But enough about me. I want to ask you, has your mindset shifted dramatically, all this time since I&#39;ve written this letter? Any small change of mindset that&#39;s resulted in big gains for you? What about some cool quotes that might initiate these changes in mindset? Have there been any interesting books you&#39;ve read that you might recommend me? How&#39;s Alan doing? Is he still being a troublemaker, or has he changed a lot? </p>
<p>Whatever happens, I hope that you know whatever has changed, I&#39;ll be accepting, don&#39;t ever think that I&#39;ll be dissapointed. </p>
<p>Sincerely,
Me</p>
