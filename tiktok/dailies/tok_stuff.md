# `Does some knowledge belong only to particular communities of knowers?`

Community might not be the same as a community of knowers, don't know if a community of algae could be considered to be a community of knowers. So we wan talk about community knowers, different types of commhnities of knowers

## Communities of knowers

What is our community of knowers?

`discipline` - Community of monks?
`group of people engaged in knowing` - teachers, students?
`religion/philosophy` - Community of catholic believers, nihilists, etc.
`countries` - community of people with a united background
`culture` - people following certain traditions or norms

## Assumptions

- Based on our definition of "belonging"
- Knowledge is not "free"
- Knowldge is not too abstract or 
- Can be someone's propoperty
